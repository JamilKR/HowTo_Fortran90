This repository pretends to be a useful guide of Fortran tricks. I will list and explain
all the problem I run into. 
I tend to programme using the Fortran90 version of this language, but I don't discard using
a newer one.

1. FaAoS = (F)unction (a)s (A)rgument (o)f (S)ubroutine
   	   This trick is useful when you need to do the same procedure with different
	   functions. This way allows you to be sure of the correct working of the global
	   subroutine.

2. OMPwL = (O)pen(M)(P) (w)ithout (L)oops
   	   The easier and most common way to parallelize (as far as I know) a program
	   is parallelizing an external loop, but ... what happens if you want to
	   compute 3 different jobs in 3 different threads at the same time? Here a
	   modest example.
